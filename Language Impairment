Q1) What is language impairment?
Speech and language impairment can be defined as the communication disorder that adversely affects one's ability to read, write, talk and understand. It can occur in both children as well as
adults

Q2) What is Communication disorder?
It is the impairment in the ability to send, receive, process and comprehend concepts or verbal, non verbal and graphic symbol systems
3 types:-
1) Disorders of voice
2) Disorders of speech 
3) Disorders of Language

Language disorders in children -> development disorder -> dyslexia
Language disorders due to genetic issue -> verbal dyspraxia
Language impairments in adults -> Aphasia and dementia -> due to brain injury or aging

Q3) Three types of disorder of speech
1) Articulation Disorder -> An articulation disorder is the atypical production of speech sounds characterized by substitution, omission, addition or distortions that may interfere with the
intelligibility.
2) Fluency Disorder -> A fluency disorder is an interuption in the flow of speaking characterized by atypical rate, rhythm and repitition of sounds, syllable, words and phrases. this may be
accompanied by excessive tension, struggled behaviour and secondary mannerism.
3) Motor Speech Disorder -> It is the class of speech disorder that affects the body's natural ability to speak due to neurological impairments. These neurologic impairments makes it difficult
for the individual with motor speech disorder to plan, program, control, coordinate and execute the speech production. eg Dsyarthria.

Q4) List of Articulation Disorder 
1) Substitution -> occurs when a sound is substituted for one they can not pronounce.
    E.g. “wed” for “red,” “thoap” for “soap”.
2) Omission -> occurs when a sound is left out that is too hard.
    E.g. “p_ay the piano” for “play the piano”, “g_een _nake” for “green snake” .
3) Addition -> occurs when an extra sound is added.
    E.g. “buhlack horse” for “black horse”, “doguh” for “dog”

Q5) Causes of Articulation Disorder 
-> Articulation disorder may results from the abnormal structure of articulators, faulty learning, due to hearing loss, due to neurological damage.
-> In children:-
  -> Faulty learning is the foremost reason in children
  -> Hearing loss causes trouble with vowels and consonants in sever cases
  -> Structural differences such as cleft palate or poor dentation (misalignment of teeth or poor shape of dental arc)
  -> neurological celebral palsy results in tight muscles that may cause a delay in articulation and poor coordination

Q6) List of Fluency Disorder
1) Alogia -> It is the inability to speak due to mental defect, mental confusion, or aphasia. it is a speech disturbance that can be seen in the people with dementia. It is characterized
by lack of speech, often caused by a distruption in the thought process.
    -> Cause -> It is caused usually due to an injury in the left hemisphere of the brain that processes meaning in language.
    -> Symptoms -> Answers to questions are very brief. There is no spontaneous additions to conversations and the responder may sometime fail to answer the question presented. Also, 
        patients slur in their speech and have difficulty in pronouncing consonants.
2) Stuttering -> Stuttering is the communication disorder in which the flow of speech is broken by repetitons(li-like this), prolonagtions(lllllike this) or abnormal stoppages(no sound)
of sound and syllable. there may also be unusual facial and body moments associated with efforts to speak.
    -> causes:-
        -> Genetics (Approximately 60% who stutter have a family member with this disorder)
        -> Child Developments (Children with other speech and language problems or development delays are more likely to stutter)
        -> Neaurophysiology (recent neurological research has shown that people who stutter process speech and language in slightly different way than those who do not stutter)
        -> family dynamics (high expectations and fast paced life style ca contribute to stuttering)
    -> Symptoms:-
        -> Stuttered speech often includes repetition of words or parts of words, as well as prologation of speech sound.
        -> Some patients appear "out of breath" while talking
        -> Speech may become completely stopped or blocked
        -> interjections occur.
  eg:- "W-W-W-Where are you going?"(repetition), "SSSSAve me a seat"(prolongation) refer slide 3 eg
3) Aprosodia
