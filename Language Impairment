Q1) What is language impairment?
Speech and language impairment can be defined as the communication disorder that adversely affects one's ability to read, write, talk and understand. It can occur in both children as well as
adults

Q2) What is Communication disorder?
It is the impairment in the ability to send, receive, process and comprehend concepts or verbal, non verbal and graphic symbol systems
3 types:-
1) Disorders of voice
2) Disorders of speech 
3) Disorders of Language

Language disorders in children -> development disorder -> dyslexia
Language disorders due to genetic issue -> verbal dyspraxia
Language impairments in adults -> Aphasia and dementia -> due to brain injury or aging

Q3) Three types of disorder of speech
1) Articulation Disorder -> An articulation disorder is the atypical production of speech sounds characterized by substitution, omission, addition or distortions that may interfere with the
intelligibility.
2) Fluency Disorder -> A fluency disorder is an interuption in the flow of speaking characterized by atypical rate, rhythm and repitition of sounds, syllable, words and phrases. this may be
accompanied by excessive tension, struggled behaviour and secondary mannerism.
3) Motor Speech Disorder -> It is the class of speech disorder that affects the body's natural ability to speak due to neurological impairments. These neurologic impairments makes it difficult
for the individual with motor speech disorder to plan, program, control, coordinate and execute the speech production. eg Dsyarthria.

Q4) List of Articulation Disorder 
1) Substitution -> occurs when a sound is substituted for one they can not pronounce.
    E.g. “wed” for “red,” “thoap” for “soap”.
2) Omission -> occurs when a sound is left out that is too hard.
    E.g. “p_ay the piano” for “play the piano”, “g_een _nake” for “green snake” .
3) Addition -> occurs when an extra sound is added.
    E.g. “buhlack horse” for “black horse”, “doguh” for “dog”

Q5) Causes of Articulation Disorder 
-> Articulation disorder may results from the abnormal structure of articulators, faulty learning, due to hearing loss, due to neurological damage.
-> In children:-
  -> Faulty learning is the foremost reason in children
  -> Hearing loss causes trouble with vowels and consonants in sever cases
  -> Structural differences such as cleft palate or poor dentation (misalignment of teeth or poor shape of dental arc)
  -> neurological celebral palsy results in tight muscles that may cause a delay in articulation and poor coordination

Q6) List of Fluency Disorder
1) Alogia -> It is the inability to speak due to mental defect, mental confusion, or aphasia. it is a speech disturbance that can be seen in the people with dementia. It is characterized
by lack of speech, often caused by a distruption in the thought process.
    -> Cause -> It is caused usually due to an injury in the left hemisphere of the brain that processes meaning in language.
    -> Symptoms -> Answers to questions are very brief. There is no spontaneous additions to conversations and the responder may sometime fail to answer the question presented. Also, 
        patients slur in their speech and have difficulty in pronouncing consonants.
2) Stuttering -> Stuttering is the communication disorder in which the flow of speech is broken by repetitons(li-like this), prolonagtions(lllllike this) or abnormal stoppages(no sound)
of sound and syllable. there may also be unusual facial and body moments associated with efforts to speak.
    -> causes:-
        -> Genetics (Approximately 60% who stutter have a family member with this disorder)
        -> Child Developments (Children with other speech and language problems or development delays are more likely to stutter)
        -> Neaurophysiology (recent neurological research has shown that people who stutter process speech and language in slightly different way than those who do not stutter)
        -> family dynamics (high expectations and fast paced life style ca contribute to stuttering)
    -> Symptoms:-
        -> Stuttered speech often includes repetition of words or parts of words, as well as prologation of speech sound.
        -> Some patients appear "out of breath" while talking
        -> Speech may become completely stopped or blocked
        -> interjections occur.
  eg:- "W-W-W-Where are you going?"(repetition), "SSSSAve me a seat"(prolongation) refer slide 3 eg
3) Aprosodia -> It is a disorder characterized by inability to express and comprehend affective and non-affective tonal aspects of speech.
    -> Affective prosody communicates the emotional meaning of the utterance as well as the affective disposition of the speaker.
    -> Nonaffective prosody communicates the linguistic and other non affective aspects of speech, thereby clarifying the syntactic 
        structure and semantic intention of an utterence.
    Causes:-
    -> Is caused due to brain injury, neurologic disorders, and certain psychiatric conditions.
    -> Usually said to be arising due to right-hemisphere neocortical damage, but can also occur with left-hemisphere damage and with
        subcortical damage.
    Symptoms:-
    -> In case of people suffering from Aprosodia, prosodic dysfunction can be described at the level of functional communication 
    (ie, impact on affective versus nonaffective speech) or at the level of acoustic processing (eg, deficits in perceiving or generating 
    pitch, timing, tempo, etc.).
4) Alalia -> Alalia or speech delay is a speech disorder, charaterized by partial or complete inability of child to speak. The child has 
rudimentary speech and scanty vocabulary that creates problem in construction of words and phrases.
    Symptoms:-
    -> If a child is not saying 3-5 words by the age of 1 year or its vocabulary is not expanding to 15-20 words by the age of 15 months,
    he/she most likely to suffer from Alalia
    -> If at 15 months, a child is not communicating using words like "ma" and "no" it's a sure shot sign of alalia.
    -> From ages 2 to 4, if a child cannot use words in phrases or sentences, he does not use consonant sounds, or has a hard time 
    following directions, one should seek therapy for alalia.
    Causes:-
    -> Speech delay can be caused by a physical abnormality in the mouth such as a deformed frenulum, lips, or palate.
    -> Other reasons could be due to oral-motor dysfunction, which is a lack or delay in the area of the brain that speech is formed and 
    created and communicated to the mouth and tongue.

Q7) Explain Dysarthria
In a person with dysarthria, a nerve, brain, or muscle disorder makes it difficult to use or control the muscles of the mouth, tongue,
larynx, or vocal cords. The muscles are weak or paralyzed.
    Causes:-
    -> Main causes of dysarthria are brain injury , Parkinson disease and stroke.
    Symptoms:-
    A person suffering from dysarthria may show the following language deficits:
    • "Slurred," "choppy," or "mumbled" speech that may be difficult to understand.
    • Slow rate of speech.
    • Abnormal pitch and rhythm when speaking.
    • Changes in voice quality, such as hoarse or breathy voice or speech that sounds "nasal" or "stuffy”. (ASHA)

Q8) Disorders of Language
A language disorder is a impaired comprehension and/or use of spoken, written, and/or other symbol system.
The disorder may involve:-
1) The form of language(phonology, morphology, syntax)
2) The content of language(semantics)
3) The function of language in communication in any combination(pragmatics)
Some of the language disorder fall under the category of the developmental disorders such as Dyslexia and SLI(specific Language impairment)

Q9) Phonological Deficits
-> Acquisition of phonological skills are delayed in children.
-> The variety of syllable structure used by the children are less varied as compared to that of children of their age.
-> Difficulty learning the speech sound system of language resulting in poor repetition of single and multisyllabic non-words.
-> limited phonological awareness (e.g., rhyming, sound/syllable deleting, segmentation, and blending).

Q10) Morphological and Syntactic Deficits
-> Delay in acquisition of various word combinations.
-> Restricted mean length of utterance (MLU) in morphemes for younger children.
-> Errors of verbs and function words.
-> Difficulty comprehending grammatical morphemes.
-> Deficits in morphological awareness (e.g., derivational morphemes, such as prefixes and suffixes, including inflectional morphology, 
such as plural, present progressive, and past tense markers)
-> Difficulty in comprehending and identifying parts of speech.

Q11) Semantic Deficits
-> The rate of development of vocabulary in children is slow and the first words are acquired quite late.
-> delays in verb acquisition, particularly in languages in which verbs are highly inflected morphologically.
-> Issues with clarity.
-> Problems in paraphrasing and making sense of directions.
-> Problems comprehending and using synonyms and antonyms, multiple-meaning words, and figurative language (e.g., idioms, metaphors, 
proverbs, humor, poetic language).

Q12) Pragmatic Deficits
-> Issues with understanding others.
-> Have problems in expressing ideas, feelings, and personal experience.
-> Difficulty initiating and sustaining conversations.
-> Problems in turn-taking during a conversation.
-> Difficulty using language to sequence events of a story—narratives lack cohesion.
