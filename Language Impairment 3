Q1) What is Aphasia?
• Is a communication disorder
• Caused due to brain injury to the language areas
• Affects reading, writing, listening and speaking but not one’s intelligence level
Types:-
-> Global Aphasia - Most severe
-> Broca’s Aphasia - Production problem
-> Wernicke’s Aphasia - Comprehension Problem
-> Anomia - Naming Problem
-> Conduction Aphasia - Problem in repetition
Symptoms:-
• An impairment of language ability.
• One can have the problem in remembering words.
• Unable to speak or unable to comprehend.
• Unable to read or write.
Assessment:-
• Speaking : Fluent or not
• Comprehension
• Repetition
• Naming
• Reading and writing

Q2) Paraphasia
• A feature of aphasia.
• One loses the ability to speak correctly.
• Substitutes one word for other.
• Generally after a stroke or brain injury.
• During the time of speaking, unintended syllable, words are uttered.
• Speech is fluent but full of errors. eg train for treen
Three types:-
1) Phonological or literal or phonemic
• Syllables are spoken in the wrong order.
• pipe ---- hike; ice --- lice
2) Neologistic
• Refers to a spoken word that is less than half correct. For instance, Banana - Balenti etc.
3) Verbal
• Substitution of words - an unintended word is used instead of other.
• The substituted word is related to the replaced word or not.
• When substituted word is related to the replaced word it is semantic paraphasia.
• Example: Television – Computer
• When the substituted word is arbitrary it is known as Remote paraphasia.
Cause:-
• Common cause- Stroke
• Language areas affected.
• Other causes- progressive neurological disorders , brain tumors or traumatic brain injury.
Symptoms
• Varies on area and extent of damage to brain areas.
• Damage to front part- good understanding ability but non-fluent speech.
• Damage to posterior part- fluent speech but problems in understanding.

Q3) discuss some common difficulties aphasics face.
1) Language Production Difficulties
• Experience difficulties in coming up with words they want to speak.
• Substitute the intended word with another word that may be related in meaning to the target (e.g., "chicken" for "fish") or unrelated 
(e.g., "radio" for "ball")
• Switch sounds within words (e.g., "wish dasher" for "dishwasher")
• Use made-up words (e.g., "frigilin" for "hamburger")
2) Problems in understanding language
• Misunderstand others when people speak in a fast manner or utter long sentences.
• Misinterpret jokes.
• Do not understand figurative speech.
3) Reading and writing Issues
• Problems in reading forms, pamphlets, books, and other written material.
• Difficulty reading non-content words (e.g., function words such as to, from, the).
• Issues with spellings and putting words together to make up a sentence.
• Writing sentences with incorrect grammar.
• Issues with number concepts (mathematical operations)

Q4) Diagnosis for Aphasia
• First the physician treating the brain injury/stroke checks for the exact location of damage.
• MRI/CT
• If these brain imaging methods provide evidence for aphasia, referred to SLP (Speech-Language Pathologist)
• The SLP does a comprehensive overview of the following things for aphasia:
  • Auditory Comprehension
  • Verbal Expression
  • Reading and Writing
  • Functional Communication

Q5) Types of Aphasia
Broadly divided into two types: fluent and non-fluent aphasia.
• Fluent:-                              
  • Wernicke’s Aphasia                    
  • Trans cortical Sensory Aphasia      
  • Conduction Aphasia
  • Anomic Aphasia
• Non-Fluent:-
  • Global Aphasia
  • Broca’s Aphasia
  • Trans cortical mixed Aphasia
  • Trans cortical motor Aphasia
refer to the classification of Aphasia from slides pg 25

Q6) Broca’s Aphasia
• Non-fluent aphasia
• Damage in the anterior portion of the left hemisphere
• Issues with comprehension of language
• Agrammatism
• Content words (nouns, verbs) may be preserved
• Telegraphic Speech
• Utterance of only single words in severe form
• Repetition of words and sentences is poor

Q7) Transcortical Motor Aphasia(TMA)
• Caused by damage in the anterior superior frontal lobe.
• Communication between Broca's area and the pre-motor or supplementary motor area (Broadmann's Area 6) is cut off.
• Great difficulty initiating and organizing responses in conversation.
• utterances are often one to two words long, and complete sentences are rare
• Auditory comprehension is good.

Q8) Trans-cortical Mixed Aphasia
• Caused by isolation of Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area and arcuate fasciculus from other brain areas.
• severe speaking and comprehension impairment, but with preserved repetition
• Patients struggle greatly to produce propositional language or to understand what is being said to them.
• Non-fluent

Q9) Global Aphasia
• Caused by injuries to language-processing areas of the brain, notably Wernicke's and Broca's areas.
• Severe impairment of both expressive and receptive skills.
• Patients are alert and express themselves through facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.
• Unable to read and write.

Q10) Wernicke’s Aphasia
• Fluent Aphasia
• Caused due to damage in the posterior portion of the left hemisphere/Wernicke’s area.
• Poor comprehension capabilities.
• Repetition of words is poor.
• Speech is fluent but meaningless.

Q11) Trans cortical Sensory Aphasia
• lesions in the inferior left temporal lobe of the brain located near Wernicke's area.
• A type of fluent aphasia.
• Poor comprehension
• Echolalia
• Neologisms in speech
• Semantic paraphasia

Q12) Conduction Aphasia
• Caused due to damage to the arcuate fasciculus.
• Good auditory comprehension
• Fluent speech but poor repeating abilities
• Substitute sounds

Q13) Anomic Aphasia
• mild form of aphasia
• caused by damage to various parts of the parietal lobe or the temporal lobe.
• Word-retrieval difficulties
• Use of generic fillers in utterances
• Comprehension and repetition of words and sentences is typically good
