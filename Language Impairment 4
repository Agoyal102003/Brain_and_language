Decoding Reading: the process
While language is prerequisite to reading, the skill requires much more than just language.
• It involves perception, memory, thinking and intelligence.
• If one decodes reading, as a process it requires:
Identifying letters -> Forming words -> Accessing meaning for the word -> Retaining the word in memory -> Think about the encoded message
• Further, this procedure takes place recursively, till the sentence ends.
• This becomes more fascination as we point out the fact that an average adult reader can read 250-300 words per minute, despite the fact 
that all these processes are concurrently involved.

people with dyslexia have difficulty in deciphering, reading and thus comprehending texts.
Q1) Dyslexia can surface in different forms. It could involve impairment of
• phonological awareness: not being able to detect phonemes. For instance not being able to perceive the ‘-t’ in goat.
• phonological reading: the inability of reading/identifying words in isolation.
• phonological coding: this involves working memory rendering to a difficulty in remembering strings of phonemes.
• lexical access: Difficulty in accessing words from long term memory, leading to a delay in recognition.

Q2) Dyslexia can be both developmental or acquired.
• Developmental Dyslexia implies a difficulty in reading that begins in childhood and continues throughout. A result of abnormal learning 
during the normal course of development despite adequate leaning and instructional opportunities and normal intelligence.
• Acquired Dyslexia is a condition that surfaces due to a traumatic brain damage. Caused by damage in the posterior temporal lobe of 
left hemisphere.

Q3)Skills involved in Reading: Perception
• The perceptual ability relates to the ability of recognising letters in the face of orthographic differences such as font and case.
• These letters are then phonologically coded i.e. associated with sounds.
• This process is especially difficult for readers of languages that have an opaque orthography to phonology mapping.
• For instance in English: ‘to’ vs ‘do’ vs ‘go’.
• Once this step of phonologically coding is done, one needs to associate the string of sounds to form a word and then linked it to a 
meaning, this is the lexical process.
• Next, as words are read recursively, one needs to understand the text as a whole, this is known as the comprehension process.
