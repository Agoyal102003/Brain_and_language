Q1) What is levelt's speech production process?
conceptualization 
-> involves determining what to say 
-> speaker concieves an intention 
-> speaker selects the relavant information in the preparation of construction of intended utterance
-> its product is pre verbal message 

Formulation 
-> involves translation of conceptualized representation into the linguistic form
-> includes the process of lexication, where words that speaker wants to say are selected
-> includes the process of syntactic planning, where words are joined to form a sentence
-> involves detailed phonetic and articulatory planning
-> includes the process of phonological encoding, where words are converted into sound

Articulation 
-> involves the retrival of the chunks of internal speech from buffer
-> involves motor execution
-> we execute the plan through the muscles in the speech system.

Self-monitoring
Finally, we monitor our speech, to assess whether it is what we intended to say and how we intended to say it”.

Q2) What is spoonerism 
This is an error in speech when two sounds, morphemes, etc are interchanged/switched.

Q3) What is malapropism
It is a mistake done for similar sound

Q4) what is freudian slip 
also known as parapraxis.
slip of tongue  - speech error
This mistake occurs because of the unconsious wish 

what is slip of tongue?
The slip of tongue is a inadvertent linguistic error, at the level of phonemes(beast instead of feast), or at the level of morphemes(after instead of before) or even higher level (kicked
the bucket instead of bought the bucket
-> slips have allegedly been associated to indicate repressed emotions
-> slips, however are a performance issue. The speaker has the idea intact but their language falters. they thus exhibit a lack of correspondance in language and thought.
-> These are usually owing to the intrusion of a different thought, a background noise or owing to some stimuli in the environment.

slips could be a result of :-
1) Anticipation -> using an element before it was appropriate eg -> expiring expression instead of inspiring expression
2) preservation -> using an element that was apt earlier but is no longer appropriate. eg-> bounteous beast instead of bounteous feast
3) substitution -> substituting one element for another. eg -> after it is too late instead of before it is too late
4) Reversal -> Transposing two elements eg -> flutterby instead of butterfly
5) Spoonerism -> This is an error when two sounds/morphemes, etc are interchanged/switched. eg -> " you have hissed all my mystery lectures" instead of " you have missed all my history lec"
6) Malapropism -> It is the mistake done for similar sound eg -> "knotty pine" instead of "naughty pine"
7) Insertions -> Adding an extra sound which is not required eg -> "Mischevious" rather than "Mischevous"
8) Deletions -> Removing a sound which was required eg "prossing" instead of "processing"
9) Shift -> That's so she'll be ready in case she decide to hits so.(decides to hit)
10) Exchange -> Fancy getting your model renosed(nose remodelled)
11) Blend -> That child is looking to be spaddled(spanked/paddled)

-> Slips also have a pattern of occurance 
-> Word category is preserved, verbs interfere with verbs and nouns interfere with nouns
-> stressed words are more likely to influence the unstressed words
-> Rhythemic and tonal patterns are preserved in slips, missed becomes hissed
-> Semantic category is also preserved, fruits for apple
-> Further, semantic category can only extend to a whole and never reduced to a part. eg -> apple to extended to fruit but fruit is never reduced to apple.
-> Grammaticality of the sentence is also preserved. eg -> " a needle" also becomes " an idol"

Q5) what is Psycholinguistic explanation 
-> Fromkin has shown that many of the errors that change and move in speech errors are precisely those postulated by linguistic theories.
-> lending support to the notion that linguistic units such as phonetic features, phonemes, and morphemes constitute planning units during the process of production of the utterance.
-> In conceptualization, speaker concieves an intention and select relevant information from memory or the environment in preparation for the contruction of the intended utterance.
-> Levelt's distinguised between 
  -> Macroplanning -> it involves elaboration of the communicative goal into a series of subgoals and retrival of approapriate information.
  -> Microplanning -> It involves assigning the right propositional shape to these chunks of information, and deciding on matters such as what the focus of utterance will be.

  Series Model
  Fromkin and Garrett have suggested that the process of planning speech can be viewed as a series of stages.
  Stage 1 -> Identification of the meaning - a meaning to be conveyed is generated
  Stage 2 -> Selection of a Syntactic Structure - a syntactic outline of the sentence is constructed, with words slot specified
  Stage 3 -> Generation of intonation contour -> the stress values of different words are asssigned
  Stage 4 -> Insertion of content word - appropriate noun, verbs and adjectives are retrieved from the lexicon and placed into words slots
  Stage 5 -> Formation of affixes and function words - function words(articles, conjuctions, prepositions), prefixes and suffixes are added.
  Stage 6 -> Specification of phonetic segments - the sentence is expressed in terms of phonetic segments, according to phonological rule.

  Garrett's model of speech production 
  Stages of Garrett's Model:
  -> Functional Level: The semantic content of words is specified. The syntactic roles such as subject and object are assigned.
      Output: A representation of the sentence's meaning with assigned syntactic roles, but without word order.
  -> Positional Level: Words are explicitly ordered based on syntax. Specific grammatical forms (e.g., function words, affixes) are inserted.
      Output: The sentence structure, including word order and grammatical markers.
  -> Phonological Level: The phonological forms of the words are retrieved and organized for pronunciation.
      Output: A phonetic plan that specifies how the sentence should sound.
  -> Articulatory Level: The phonetic plan is executed through the speech muscles (e.g., tongue, lips, vocal cords).
      Output: Physical production of speech.
  -> Monitoring Level: Speech is monitored for errors, allowing self-correction.
      Output: Ensuring that the output matches the intended message.
